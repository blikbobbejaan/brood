//! Backend-independent lowering decisions — *whether* and *how* an arm should be lowered,
//! as opposed to the code generation that carries it out.
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function of the arm's bytecode, its `Node` body, its tier-time
//! slot profile, and the opt-out env flags. No Cranelift type appears: a second backend (or any
//! other consumer — a report, a tool) reads these decisions rather than re-deriving them.
//!
//! # Two tiers
//!
//! | tier | what it decides | gated on `feature = "jit"` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | this module's top level | frame layout — [`jit_spill_reserve`], [`jit_ckpt_depth`] and the predicates they rest on | **no** — the VM sizes frames whether or not a backend exists |
//! | [`codegen`] | what emitted code may assume, where it may hoist, whether emitting is worth it | yes, once, on the module |
//!
//! So `jit_plan::codegen::…` at a use site says "this needs a backend to mean anything", and the
//! frame-layout half compiles in a build with no backend at all — where it is still needed.
//!
//! # Why this separation is the valuable half of the seam
//!
//! (`docs/backend-seams.md` §3.) Each decision here has a measurement session behind it, and
//! several encode a *negative* result that is invisible in the code that benefits from it:
//!
//! - [`codegen::plan_general_lowering`]'s call-mediated gate exists because lowering the
//!   boxed-call shape regresses `nbody` 15–20%, and removing it (§7.1 step 2) regressed every
//!   row, winners included.
//! - [`codegen::inst_allocates_hot`] is deliberately narrower than
//!   [`codegen::inst_may_allocate`] because including the table ops cost `sieve` 6%.
//! - [`jit_spill_reserve`] is liveness-driven because a hardcoded `1` made a two-call recursion
//!   bail (`tests/jit.rs`).
//!
//! A backend re-implementing codegen is mechanical work. A backend re-deriving *these* would
//! re-pay for each of those findings, which is the real hazard a swap carries — so they live
//! above the backend, in one place, where they can be read without reading a lowerer.
//!
//! # What consolidating them removed
//!
//! [`jit_spill_reserve`] and [`jit_ckpt_depth`] were each defined **twice**: a real version
//! inside the jit-gated `jit_lower`, and a zero/`None` stub in `compile.rs` for builds
//! without the feature. `jit_lower` *also* carried its own `#[cfg(not(feature = "jit"))]`
//! copies, which could never compile at all — the module they sit in only exists when the
//! feature is on. Four definitions, two of them unreachable; one each now.
