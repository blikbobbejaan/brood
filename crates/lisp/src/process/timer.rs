//! Receive-timeout (`(after ms expr)`) machinery: a min-heap of pending
//! deadlines + one OS thread that wakes parked green processes at their
//! due times.
//!
//! Hooks into the scheduler via [`super::wake_for_timeout`] — the one piece
//! of mailbox plumbing this module needs. That helper takes a pid + park
//! generation, finds its mailbox in `REGISTRY`, and (if the gen is still
//! current) re-queues the parked waiter so it wakes, re-scans its mailbox,
//! and notices the deadline has passed.
//!
//! **Lazy cancellation, with compaction.** A superseded entry is not removed the moment
//! its park is superseded (a `BinaryHeap` cannot remove an interior element); each entry
//! carries the park **generation** it was armed under, and `wake_for_timeout` drops one
//! whose gen the mailbox has advanced past (see `Mailbox::timer_gen`). Reaping only at
//! the deadline would bound the heap by `arm-rate × horizon` — the message rate times the
//! timeout — so [`arm_timer`] also **compacts** once the heap passes twice its live size
//! (and a floor): amortized O(1) per arm, and the steady-state size tracks the number of
//! *currently parked* processes.
