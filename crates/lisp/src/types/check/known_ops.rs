//! The named functions the checker knows something about beyond their signatures — one
//! definition per set, read by the rules in `infer.rs`, `guards.rs` and `walk/calls.rs`.
//!
//! A rename that leaves a name behind here does not break a rule loudly: the rule just
//! stops firing, and the checker quietly knows less. So every set is a plain `&[&str]`
//! that `tests/checker_known_names_exist.rs` reads out of this file and resolves in a
//! fresh image.
